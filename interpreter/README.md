# Interpreter

The Interpreter does NOT emulate micropython, but rather provides a desktop executable wrapper for a HeraldApplet.
This executes your wearable applet and provides it data in the same way that our Micropython wearable would
use your code. This provides you with a way to test your code before deploying it to a real device.
