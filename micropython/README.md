# Micropython Shim

This folder contains the Python code that links Micropython on Zephyr to Herald, and allows Herald to provide a wrapper to execute your HeraldApplet code
on a micropython and Herald powered device.

This executes your HeraldApplet code in the same way the interpreter executes it, but does so from a real, physical device.
